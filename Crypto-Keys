The description: Can you decrypt the message?
Title: Keys

That's all to go on.

Grab the zip file:
wget https://www.hackthebox.eu/storage/challenges/crypto/keys.zip
unzip with the password provided on the challenge.

Simple txt file with something that looks like a pair of base64 entries. However it isn't base64.

I couldn't figure out for the life of me what it was. 2 strings, keys decrypt the message.

Finally I tossed in the towel and googled the first string. Top result was a link that automatically decrypted the whole thing.

It's a disappointing situation for sure. No real learning at that point if you are in the game to simply capture flags and points.

Since the webpage that spit out the flag had the code there, I took a look and did some googling.

I wouldn't have figured out anything like the symmetric encryption used in the challenge. Perhaps if I had visited the python-guide.org
crypto page.

The gist is to take what you would use to generate a key and encrypt your message and reverse the process supplying the key and message.
