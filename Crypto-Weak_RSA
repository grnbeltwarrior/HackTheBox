I ran into the issue of an error of: ImportError: No module named gmpy2

Before I could install it via: pip install gmpy2==2.1..0a2
apt install libgmp-dev
apt install libmpfr-dev
apt install libmpc-dev

Then gmpy2 will install via pip.

Then you can run RsaCtfTool.py using the switches that match the files given in the challenge.
